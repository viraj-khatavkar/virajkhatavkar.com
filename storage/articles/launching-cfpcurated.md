This is not a product. It's a simple email newsletter. It's about scratching my itch. I wanted to restart my speaking engagements and was searching for something to give me a simple list of open CFPs for PHP & JS developers. Couldn't find anything so decided to sit down and check every open cfp once a week.

Every Saturday, I'll email you a list of open "call for papers" for conferences related to php & js. The email will include conference name, date, location, and details of speaker package. I'm doing this for myself, and you're welcome to join me.

[You can join this list](https://cfpcurated.com) if you want to get this information as well. It is a no-nonsense list, i.e. I won't spam you ever. I'll never share your email with anyone. You will get one email every Saturday. If there aren't any open cfps, you will get an email saying "No open cfps this week", nothing else. I'll never try to upsell you a product through this list.

THIS LIST IS MEANT ONLY FOR RECEIVING A WEEKLY EMAIL ABOUT OPEN CFPS RELATED TO PHP, JS AND DESIGN. NOTHING ELSE. PERIOD.
