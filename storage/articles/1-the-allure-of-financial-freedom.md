Financial freedom is not equal to retirement. Retirement can happen forcefully. You may be forced to retire if you reach a certain age or if you get handicapped or maybe due to other health reasons. While, financial freedom is a state where you have enough money saved that you no longer require to do a job for your daily expenses.
