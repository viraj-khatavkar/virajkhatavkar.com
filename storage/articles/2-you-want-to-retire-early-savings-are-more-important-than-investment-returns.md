## The Allure of Investment Returns

How many times have we wondered about getting that extra investment return by using risky investment products? I have certainly lost a decent amount of money in chasing high returns. The problem was that I felt higher investment returns are necessary if I want to be financially independent. But I couldn't be more wrong. A 25% return on a small capital of 1 lakh rupees is a meager 25,000. WHile a simple 10% return on one crore comes out to be ten lakhs, which can be many months of expenses for the most of us. The more we focus on savings rate, the less we need to dabble onto risky assets in the lure of high investment returns. We can never control what returns we get, but we can always control our savings.

## Why Savings are More Important in the First Ten Years

Let's assume we invest 20,000 rupees per month, and we get a 14% return every year. The above table shows how our money would grow over the next fifteen years if we continue our contribution every month. In the first year, the savings are about 88% of our total net-worth, while the interest earned (returns) are only 12%. Even in the fifth year, the savings still form a substantial 66% of our total net-worth. It's only in the year ten that the returns part of our total net worth is higher than the savings. But even after ten years, savings are a staggering 45% of our entire corpus.

This calculation should help us understand that for the first part of our journey, focusing on savings is more important than beating ourselves about the investment returns.


## The Power of Compounding

This table shows how our investment grows over twenty-five years. It also shows the power of compounding. Compounding is usually back-ended, meaning the real benefits of compounding comes at the later part of the investment period.

> Compounding is the repeated addition of interest payments to the principal invested over a period of time. The principal grows exponentially as each new payment of interest is added to it. - Investopedia

The compounding effect shows its effect once we enter into the 20th year of our investment journey. The total savings we contributed are only 20 percent of our total net worth, while the returns we earned are a substantial 80 percent. This is how compounding of our money helps us become wealthy and financially independent.

If you had instead used this money for materialistic possessions, it would not have contributed to generating wealth.

Save. Invest. Become Wealthy.
