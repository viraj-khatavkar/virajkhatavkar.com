## Story Time

Let's start with a short story about my friend. We'll call him Vikas. He is from a middle-class family who graduated in engineering from Mumbai University in 2014. Vikas didn't have an education loan or any other loans for that matter. After graduation, he got a job in one of the software companies with a package of around five lakhs per year. This was a respectable package back in those days. In the first year of his job, he saved around two lakh rupees i.e., almost half of his salary before taxes. Saving 50% of our own salary is a great start and shows financial prudence. The story doesn't end here. In the second year, he spent all his savings in the downpayment of a car worth ten lakh rupees and took a loan for the remainder amount. He went from a positive net worth of 2.5 lakhs to a negative worth of 7.5 lakhs.

Vikas used that car for couple of days a month. Once a year, he might go for a vacation of 7-8 days, but that's it. This is a very typical story with our friends and many times, ourselves. Is it worth to buy a new car on EMIs when we rarely use it for the commute? Wouldn't it be better to buy a used car? Most of us make these decisions emotionally. When we buy a car, the moment it comes out of the showroom, the value of that car decreases by 40%. [When we own a house](https://virajkhatavkar.com/3-should-you-buy-a-house), the value might appreciate over the very long-term. But a car's value always depreciates the longer we own it.

## Actual Costs of Owning a Car on EMI

Vikas took a loan of 7.5 lakhs at the rate of 9.75% for six years to own a car. Below is the detail on his EMI and total payments over those six years:

Vikas paid back a total of 10 lakhs in those six years. The total cost for the ownership of his car comes around 12.5 lakhs. I am not even considering the fuel, parking charges, service, PUC, and a ton of other things that come with car ownership.

## Depreciating Assets

I avoid buying depreciating assets **on EMIs**. Car is a usable product, but it depreciates in value. I am not saying that we should never buy a car. My only concern is that we spend most of our accumulated savings in buying such a depreciating product. Instead we should be investing our money to [beat inflation](https://virajkhatavkar.com/4-inflation-is-a-hidden-expense).

Even if we spend fifteen thousand rupees per month on Ola/Uber, it will take us around six years of using cabs to justify the cost of merely owning a car without considering the fuel and maintenance expenses. I don't own a car because I cannot justify its expense or use. Do I want to own a car? Definitely YES! Do I want to buy on EMIs? NO!!

Other examples of depreciating assets are cell phones, devices, clothing, luxury spends, etc. The problem is not with splurging on these things. I spend on these said examples, but it doesn't cost me all of my savings or erode a significant percent of my net worth.

## My Personal Decision

I am not an idealistic person who doesn't own any depreciating assets. My depreciating assets include an iMac, costing around 1.60 lakhs. I have the latest iPhone charging me around 1.20 lakhs. But I never bought them on EMIs. I paid in full! Buying them didn't deplete all of my savings.

I love to spend on good food. I eat at high-end fancy restaurants once every two-three months. I could splurge on fancy things because I didn't pay all of my money in a depreciating asset like a car in an instant. Experiences matter to me more than things.

It's fine to splurge on things that you love **if you can afford them!** Don't try to keep up with your neighbours. Understand what matters to you!

I definitely want to own a car sometime in the future when I can pay it in full. *My personal rule is to not own a car until the ownership cost is not more than 10% of my net worth.*
